# Federated-Learning-in-Computer-Vision

## Transformer Based Framework：

## Data Share:
**FedCG:Leverage Conditional GAN for Protecting Privacy and Maintaining Competitive Performance in Federated Learning** upload classifier and generator for each client. The server merge the generators and send back.

**FedProto: Federated Prototype Learning across Heterogeneous Clients**
Upload prototype instead of model gradients, prove to converge. Loss setting have a regularization between the server global prototype can client local prototype. The experiments are based on easy cnn nets, i.e, 2 CNN layers and 2 FC layers. 

## Personalisation & Generalisation：
**On Bridging Generic and Personalized Federated Learning**
upload hypernet for each client, and the hypernetwork is used to generate client personalised model weight.
